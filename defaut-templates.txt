# Closed then asked again
In the future, please edit a closed question rather than asking it again. It is not appropriate to ask your question a second time. Instead you need to edit your original question so that it can be reopened. When you edit a closed question it automatically enters a review queue to see if it should be reopened.

# Comment with updates
Rather than adding details in comments, please [edit] your question to add requested information. You can then comment saying that you have done so. Comments here may get hidden by "show more comments" or could be deleted without notice.

# Comment as answer
That should be posted as an answer rather than as a comment. Comments are temporary and cannot be accepted as an answer. There is no mechanism for converting comments to answers, so I cannot do it for you. You will need to copy your comment into the answer box and then delete your comment.

# Link-only answer
I [deleted](/help/deleted-answers) this because it consists almost entirely of a link. A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable.
