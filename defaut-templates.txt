# More than one question asked
I voted to close this post because it asks more than one question. Please post questions separately instead of combining your questions into one. Doing so ensures that your question is answered fully and that people with similar problems in the future will be able to find the answer. You may [edit] this post to pare it down to a single question and create separate posts for additional questions.

# Closed then asked again
In the future, please edit a closed question rather than asking it again. It is not appropriate to ask your question a second time. Instead you need to edit your original question so that it can be reopened. When you edit a closed question it automatically enters a review queue to see if it should be reopened.

# Needs details

# Text screenshots
Please [edit] this question to type the text from the image. Pictures with text are often not legible depending on the screen size of the viewer, nor are they compatible with accessibility tools such as screen readers. Text has other advantages: portions can be quoted in answers, it is easy to make or suggest corrections to it, and it can be found through search. See the [formatting documentation](/editing-help) for tips to make your text appear nicely without resorting to images.

# Comment as answer
That should be posted as an answer rather than as a comment. Comments are temporary and cannot be accepted as an answer. There is no mechanism for converting comments to answers, so I cannot do it for you. You will need to copy your comment into the answer box and then delete your comment.
types: question

# Question as answer
I deleted this because it does not answer the question. You can [search for similar questions](/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on this page to find an answer. If you have your own question which is different from the one asked here, please use the [ask question](/questions/ask) form. If needed, you can include a link to this question to help provide context.

# Thank you answer
I [deleted](/help/deleted-answers) this because it is only a “thank you” and not an answer. Once you [earn](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](/help/privileges/vote-up). Then visitors see a higher vote count on that answer, and the author will be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](/help/why-vote).

# Link-only answer
I [deleted](/help/deleted-answers) this because it consists almost entirely of a link. A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. If you [edit] this answer to add more, please flag it for moderator attention so that we can un-delete it.

# Code-only answer
[A code-only answer is not high quality](//meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/392712/explaining-entirely-code-based-answers). While this code may be useful, you can improve it by saying why it works, how it works, when it should be used, and what its limitations are.
