# Comment: Answer updates
Rather than adding details in comments, please [edit] your answer to add requested information. You can then comment saying that you have done so. Comments here may get hidden by "show more comments" or could be deleted without notice.

# Comment: OP "thanks"
Rather than commenting to say "thanks," you should show your appreciation by clicking the check mark to the left of this answer to mark it as "accepted." Doing so awards 15 reputation points to the author and visually shows others that the answer solved your problem. You can also click the up arrow there to vote the answer up. Doing so awards an additional 10 reputation points to the author and increments the score of the answer. The top scored answer is sorted to the top which helps other people with similar problems find it.

# Comment: Should be answer
That should be posted as an answer rather than as a comment. Comments are temporary and cannot be accepted as an answer. There is no mechanism for converting comments to answers, so I cannot do it for you. You will need to copy your comment into the answer box and then delete your comment.

# Misconception: Programmatic Google searches
It is against Google's [Webmaster Guidelines](//developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/webmaster-guidelines) and [terms of service](//policies.google.com/terms/archive/20020906?hl=en) to submit programmatic search queries. Running this code against Google is likely to cause Google to show captcha for searches from your IP address.

# Misconception: Meta title
There is no such thing as a "meta title." The page title uses the `<title>` tag which is separate from `<meta>` tags. Furthermore, unlike meta information about the page, the page title is visible to users in the browser tab and title bar. I've edited your question to correct the terminology.

# Misconception: XML sitemap SEO
XML sitemaps have almost nothing to do with SEO. They don't help your pages rank better and they rarely get search engines to index pages they wouldn't index anyway. At best sitemaps get search engine crawlers to crawl new pages quickly and give you extra stats in webmaster tools and search console. See [The Sitemap Paradox](/questions/4803/the-sitemap-paradox)

# Misconception: Structured data SEO
You don't need to find some structured data to apply for SEO. Unless there is relevant structured data for which Google supports a rich snippet, there is no reason to use any structured data at all. See my blog [SEO Myth: Structured data helps search engine rankings](//blog.ostermiller.org/structured-data-seo/)

# Wrong close reason, not needs focus
The close reason here is slightly misleading; your question does not contain multiple questions. I think the correct close reason should be "needs details or clarity". Please review the [help] and in particular [How to ask](/help/how-to-ask). Perhaps you can still [edit] this into a form which is acceptable on Stack Overflow.

# Question asked again after closure
In the future, please edit a closed question rather than asking it again. It is not appropriate to ask your question a second time. Instead you need to edit your original question so that it can be reopened. When you edit a closed question it automatically enters a review queue for review to be reopened.

# User: Too much self-promo
I've noticed that you've linked to your own product or website several times in your posts now. There are some [guidelines in place](/help/promotion) for doing so. In particular, I'd like to call your attention to this line: "Post good, relevant answers, and if some (**but not all**) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay." To continue contributing to this site, you must also ask and answer questions that do not involve self-promotion.
