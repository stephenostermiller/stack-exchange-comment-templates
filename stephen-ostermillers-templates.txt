# SEO off-topic
General SEO questions are off-topic. Only programming-related SEO questions are acceptable on Stack Overflow. Non-programming SEO questions should be asked on [webmasters.se]. Please delete your question here and re-ask it there.

# More than one question asked
I voted to close this post because it asks more than one question. It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. Doing so ensures that your question is answered fully and that people with similar problems in the future will find the answer. Please [edit] this post to pare it down to a single question and create separate posts for additional questions.

# Closed then asked again
In the future, please edit a closed question rather than asking it again. It is not appropriate to ask your question a second time. Instead you need to edit your original question so that it can be reopened. When you edit a closed question it automatically enters a review queue to see if it should be reopened.

# Needs details
Please [edit] your question to provide the requested details so that this can be reopened and answered.

# Off-topic not webmastering
I voted to close this question because it appears to be about [type here] and not related to running your own website.

# Off-topic programming
I voted to close this question because programming questions are off-topic here and should be asked on [so]. Before you ask there, you need to make your example minimal. You need to pare it down to just a small section of no more than 10 lines that demonstrates the problem.

# Text screenshots
Please [edit] this question to type the text from the screenshot. Then people answering the question will be able to quote the text or suggest corrections to it. Text will be able to be found through search. As it stands now, your screenshots make it hard to answer your question or for people with related issues to find your question.
types: close, question

# Comment as answer
That should be posted as an answer rather than as a comment. Comments are temporary and cannot be accepted as an answer. There is no mechanism for converting comments to answers, so I cannot do it for you. You will need to copy your comment into the answer box and then delete your comment.
types: question

# Meta title
There is no such thing as a "meta title." The page title uses the `<title>` tag which is separate from `<meta>` tags. Furthermore, unlike meta information about the page, the page title is visible to users in the browser tab and title bar. I've edited your question to correct the terminology.

# XML sitemap SEO
XML sitemaps have almost nothing to do with SEO. They don't help your pages rank better and they rarely get search engines to index pages they wouldn't index anyway. At best sitemaps get search engine crawlers to crawl new pages quickly and give you extra stats in webmaster tools and search console. See [The Sitemap Paradox](/questions/4803/the-sitemap-paradox)

# Structured data SEO
You don't need to find some structured data to apply for SEO. Unless there is relevant structured data for which Google supports a rich snippet, there is no reason to use any structured data at all. See my blog [SEO Myth: Structured data helps search engine rankings](//blog.ostermiller.org/structured-data-seo/)

# Question as answer
I deleted this because it does not answer the question. You can [search for similar questions](/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on this page to find an answer. If you have your own question which is different from the one asked here, please use the [ask question](/questions/ask) form. If needed, you can include a link to this question to help provide context.

# Thank you answer
I [deleted](/help/deleted-answers) this because it is only a “thank you” and not an answer. Once you [earn](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](/help/privileges/vote-up). Then visitors see a higher vote count on that answer, and the author will be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](/help/why-vote).

# Link-only answer
I [deleted](/help/deleted-answers) this because it consists almost entirely of a link. A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. If you [edit] this answer to add more, please flag it for moderator attention so that we can un-delete it.

# Code-only answer
[A code-only answer is not high quality](//meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/392712/explaining-entirely-code-based-answers). While this code may be useful, you can improve it by saying why it works, how it works, when it should be used, and what its limitations are.
