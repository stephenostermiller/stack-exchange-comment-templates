# Meta title
There is no such thing as a "meta title." The page title uses the `<title>` tag which is separate from `<meta>` tags. Furthermore, unlike meta information about the page, the page title is visible to users in the browser tab and title bar. I've edited your question to correct the terminology.

# XML sitemap SEO
XML sitemaps have almost nothing to do with SEO. They don't help your pages rank better and they rarely get search engines to index pages they wouldn't index anyway. At best sitemaps get search engine crawlers to crawl new pages quickly and give you extra stats in webmaster tools and search console. See [The Sitemap Paradox](/questions/4803/the-sitemap-paradox)
